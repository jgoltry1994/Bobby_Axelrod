JOINS are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a common field between them

There are INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, AND FULL JOINS: 

Since we're using JOIN, we have to specify the table and columns

INNER JOIN returns all rows when theres at least 1 match in both table

SELECT customers.firstname, customers.lastname, orders.orderNum
FROM customers INNER JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customerId ORDER BY customers.lastname;

LEFT JOIN returns rows from the left table with the matching rows on the right table

SELECT customers.firstname, customers.lastname, orders.orderNum, orders.orderDate FROM customers LEFT JOIN 
orders ON customer.id = orders.customerId ORDER BY customer.lastname;

RIGHT JOIN returns rows from the right table with the matching rows of the left table

SELECT orders.orderNum, customers.firstname, customers.lastname FROM orders RIGHT join customers ON orders.customerId 
= customer.id ORDER BY orders.orderNUM;

FULL JOIN returns all rows from the left table and the right table. It combines the result of both left and right rows. 

SELECT * FROM customers FULL JOIN orders ON customers.lastname = orders.orderNum;
