Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted() list onen item at a time. 


def insertion_sort(l): 
	for idx in range(1, len(l)): 
		value = l[idx] #the item in the list at each of the indexes that we use to compare all the items to the left
		i = idx - 1
		while i>=0: # keep pushing i further and further to the left
			if value < l[i]: # value indicates the elements of the list
				l[i+1] = l[i] #shift number i to right in i+1 
				l[i] = value #shift value left into slot i 
				i = i - 1
			else: 
				break

list = [6, 8, 1, 4, 5, 7]
insertion_sort(list)
