Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted() list one item at a time. 


def insertion_sort(my_list): 
	for idx in range(1, len(my_list)): 
		value = my_list[idx] #the item in the list at each of the indexes that we use to compare all the items to the left
		i = idx - 1 #i should have one lower than the index 
		while i>=0: # keep pushing i further and further to the left
			if value < my_list[i]: # value indicates the elements of the list
				my_list[i+1] = my_list[i] #shift number i to right in i+1 
				my_list[i] = value #shift value left into slot i 
				i = i - 1 #compare value to something 1 lower (decrement)
			else: 
				break

list = [6, 8, 1, 4, 5, 7]
insertion_sort(list)
